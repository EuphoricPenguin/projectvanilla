# Project Vanilla

A few years ago, I set out to create an open-source alternative to the MIDI Fighter. While I never succeeded, I still think this repository is an interesting glimpse into some of the work I was doing at that time. This repo contains a rudimentary mainboard schematic, some basic case design, and some of the logo ideas I was working on. I'm hardly the first person to attempt this, although I admit that retail competition for the MIDI Fighter line remains sparse to this day.
